### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Core team engineer at [Ghost](https://ghost.org), helping to deliver a robust product to tens of thousands of users :gear:

I also maintain the most popular Node.js bindings for SQLite - https://github.com/TryGhost/node-sqlite3

Commits + tags are signed with my SSH Key Fingerprint: `m6dXZiQ1UAqegltEcTT83uQPSZy93sf+74IAhWrJyFk` and NPM packages are published under [`daniellockyer`](https://www.npmjs.com/~daniellockyer).

I am generally pretty responsive to issues, pull requests and comments, but I get hundreds of notifications per week and may have missed it. If you feel like I've missed something, tag my GitHub account into a comment.
