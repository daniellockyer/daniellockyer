### Hi there 👋

I'm a performance and scaling consultant, focusing on making the web faster. Like my work? [Consider hiring me.](https://daniellockyer.com/)

Previously, I was a core team engineer at [Ghost](https://ghost.org), helping to deliver a publishing platform to tens of thousands of customers and millions of users. :gear:

You can find my website over [here](https://daniellockyer.com) and I show my work on [X](https://x.com/daniellockyer) :star2:

Commits + tags are signed with my SSH key fingerprint: `m6dXZiQ1UAqegltEcTT83uQPSZy93sf+74IAhWrJyFk` and NPM packages are published under [`daniellockyer`](https://www.npmjs.com/~daniellockyer).

I am generally pretty responsive to issues, pull requests and comments, but I get hundreds of notifications per week and may have missed it. If you feel like I've missed something, tag my GitHub account into a comment.
